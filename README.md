I want to write a program that displays system stats on my Raspberry Pi NAS. I am having a hard time getting external monitors to work with programs written with AdaFruit etc so am thinking to write a more simple one for my own purpose with the 2.8‚Äù touch screen that I have.
I want to display the following details:
-CPU Usage 
-Memory usage
-the disk space used and capacity of the external drives (NAS)
-IP Address
I am happy for this to run from the CLI however it needs to look like a unique program, not like a terminal CLI.. so for this I will need to be able to have a custom font, custom font colours, different background colour and perhaps a resize.
